Welcome to my Git profile and thank you for visiting my deep-learning & machine-learning project repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of my projects related to real-life data.

Each folder has its own details.

# Deep Learning
In this  folder, I have implemented the Resnet18 pre-trained model to classify between the negative and positive samples of crack images.

# House Price Prediction
This is a repository for a house price prediction project. The project aims to predict the prices of houses based on their features using machine learning algorithms.

# Stock Sentiment Analysis
This is a repository for a Sentiment Analysis project. The project aims to classify the sentiment of text into positive, negative, or neutral categories using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.

# Healthcare  Project
This is a repository for the Diabetic Dataset project. The project aims to analyze and predict the readmission of diabetic patients to the hospital using machine learning algorithms.

# Random Forest
This folder has different datasets on which I have applied Random Forest and insightful data analysis.
