Great! Here's an example README file for your project that you can modify and use as a starting point:

# House Price Prediction

This is a repository for a house price prediction project. The project aims to predict the prices of houses based on their features using machine learning algorithms.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file.
2. Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `House Price Prediction.ipynb`.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to load and preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and predict the house prices.
3. You can modify the notebook to train the model on different datasets or use a different machine learning algorithm.
